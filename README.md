## General Information
- Consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.
- The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default
- Data set has 39717 rows and 111 columns. 
- Data set consist of relevant information of loan characteristics and customer behavior variables

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
We cannot simply consider one or two variables to predict the default. We have defined 14 parameters which need to be considered while giving a loan. In an a application if more than 5 matching parameters are there then we should avoid giving loan for such applications, Only few are mentioned here

- grade - Grades given by LC are C,D,E,F or G
- term - Loan tenure selected is 60 months
- verification_status - Verification status is Verified
- add_state - States are one of the following CA, FL or NV
- loan_amnt - Loan amount is 15K or more
- annual_income - Annual income is 10K or less than 10K
- inq_last_6mths - 2 or more inquiries in last 6 months
